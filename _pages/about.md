I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the Kenan-Flagler Business School, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

My approach to research involves close collaboration with hospitals, providers, and technology firms to pinpoint critical issues related to resource allocation that arise in healthcare systems. My research encompasses a variety of methodologies. I combine predictive and prescriptive methods, including data-driven optimization, large-scale linear and integer programming, robust optimization, machine learning, dynamic programming, and causal inference. My model-based approach culminates in actionable solutions and valuable insights for healthcare administrators.

I have collaborated with technology firms and healthcare systems such as, Veterans Health Los Angeles, UCLA Ronald Regan Medical Center, UNC Health, Opflow, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

I teach Operations Management and Healthcare and Service Operations Management at the Kenan Flagler Business School.
